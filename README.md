# 16x16 Times Table

This is a simple 16x16 grid, for learning multiplication.

I made it for my 8yr old son, who wanted a "computing" number grid of 16x16.

Most of the times tables that I found were either:

* 12x12, or

* Larger, but just a screenshot of Excel

Hopefully this will help other parents/children out there! :)
